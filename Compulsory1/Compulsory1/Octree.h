// An octree divides 3D space into smaller regions, here octants. 
//Without an octree, you need to check every pair of balls for collision, leading to O(n^2). (16*15)/2 = 120 pairs. 
//The octree divides the box into smaller regions. When a ball is moving, it is inserted into a octant corresponding to its position. 
//With this approach you check for collision in the same octant or neighboring octants. 
//The root in this project is the box, and the octree would recursively subdivide the box into smaller regions if there are to many 
//balls in a region. 
//The octree redices the number if checks to O(nlogn) or better, depending of the distribution of the balls on the box.
